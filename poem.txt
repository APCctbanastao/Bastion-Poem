the clocks hand strikes mad
as the soldiers lay stood ironclad
the enemies are at the gate
battering my soul as of late

give up? never
for i still hold both shield and cleaver
stoic in heart, and fiery in soul
i hold my ground waving this flagpole

not for a moment shall i concede
this flickering ember, that is guaranteed
